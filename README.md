As seen in the comparative results, As the number of vector arrays has increased, the runtime for asm and simd is also increasing. The ASM is 54 times slower than the C function while the simd is significantly slower than both the asm and the c function. It is noticeable that all the functions produced the correct output.  Lastly, despite theoretically having a faster execution time, the simd had the slowest execution time. A potential reason for a slower execution time is the add instructions in the simd function. It is also noted that  the code doesnt work in release and only in debug
